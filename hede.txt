# MW Development

There are various ways to deploy & run this project. But first you need to configure your environment.

## Environment Configuration

* Make sure you have JDK6 & JDK7 installed on your machine.
* Make sure you have copied `tebmobil.properties` & `log4j.properties` files into `POZITRON_CONFIG/config/` directory.
While you may get tebmobil.properties from `src/main/resources/tebmobil.properties` consider getting `log4j.properties`
from `src/test/resources/log4j.properties` since its output is configured for stdout.
* Make sure your maven configuration is able to download not just dependencies but also sources & documentation.

## Jetty

Jetty is preferable over Tomcat since it's more lightweight & faster. A maven plugin has been added to the project so
that you can just do:

```
mvn clean jetty:run -DskipTests
```

You can also trigger this within IntelliJ IDEA and even create a Run/Debug configuration for it. All necessary JVM/Maven
parameters have already been defined inside `pom.xml`.

## Tomcat

If you have tomcat directory available in your computer then it's trivial to setup an environment using Eclipse. It runs
your code and deploys the WAR into the container. We haven't added a maven plugin for this as we already added for
jetty.

## Docker
