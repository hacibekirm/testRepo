I want to fix my latest commit message:

$ git commit --amend
Add a new remote (say that I want to work with a colleague's local branch):

$ git remote add can.oztokmak git+ssh://can.oztokmak@192.168.1.123/KillBill/Server
Clone branch 'bar' of Can to my local:

$ git checkout -t can.oztokmak/bar
Although CLI usage is much faster you may probably do all of these with Sourcetree as well. If you'd like to advance in git commands you may take a look at github tutorial.

[edit] About gerrit

gerrit is basically a code review tool which also provides source code hostingach called gerrit-flow. Instead of directly commiting to branches (including master), you commit to either draft (aka refs/drafts/foo where foo is your branch name) branches or the review (aka refs/for/foo where foo is your branch name) branches. This enforces reviewing process for all commits. All commits are merged to certain branches by gerrit itself according to review status.

[edit] Client Installati

gerrit is only installed on the central server. In order to use it, you have to install git as client.

[edit] Mac
If you have homebrew installed on your machine, issue the following command:
